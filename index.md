## Research

The broad area of my research is distributed systems.

I am currently interested in distributed data processing systems, specificially
how modern, high-performance networks challenge architectural assumptions in
streaming data processing systems.

### Work with Students

I enjoy including students in my research. Please contact me if you would like
to talk about what I'm working on right now, what you're interested in, and if
there are opportunities for you to contribute to my work.

## Teaching

I love teaching computer science because I love sharing my passion for computing
with others, particularly those who have had no or little prior experience with
it. CS is an especially exciting field of study because it enables
creativityâ€”with a foundational background in Computer Science, people can build
amazing and world-changing things.

My teaching style is informed by my belief that students learn best when they
want to learn. My role in a student's education is to not just to expose them to
new ideas, but to show them why these ideas are exciting and interesting and to
serve as guide in their discovery of knowledge.

### Referrals + Recommendations

If you would like a letter of recommendation from me or a referral from me,
there's some things I need from you first:

* We need to talk about at _least_ three weeks before the deadline. Writing a
  good letter of recommendation takes time, and I need to be able to schedule
  myself at least an hour or two to write a good letter for you. Part of this
  conversation should be about why _I_ should be writing the letter--why do you
  think that I am the best person to write a letter for you or refer you?
* You must have had me in class or have done work with me; if I don't know you
  at all, I can't recommend you for anything. If you haven't talked with me
  outside of class at all (e.g., during office hours or 1:1), then I am also
  probably not the best person to ask.
* You have to give me a current version of your resume or CV, any filled-out
  paperwork that's required for the letter, and any information that you think
  will help me write a letter.

_Note about LinkedIn:_ I only connect with students on
[LinkedIn](http://tinyr.us/me) that I have some sort of working relationship
with. If I don't know who you are, I'll ignore your request to connect.

### Inclusive + Ethical Computing

Making Computer Science education (and technology in general) inclusive is an
important priority for me.

Here's a [list](justcs.md) of resources/articles related to justice, diversity,
and inclusion in CS that I will try to maintain/update.

## Outside the Classroom

I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio, and received my Ph.D. from The Ohio State
University. Before coming to Rhodes, I was a software engineer at Google, where
I built streaming data analytics platforms for both internal and Cloud
customers. Though it was exciting to work on Google-scale distributed systems, I
missed the fulfillment that teaching undergraduates provides me, and joined
Rhodes in 2019.

I live in Midtown Memphis and outside of the classroom I enjoy food and
cooking, roller skating, ice hockey, running, and photography, among other
hobbies.

## Education

Ph.D., Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University

## Feedback

In order to provide you with an opportunity to give me feedback in
semi-real-time, I've created this [form](https://forms.gle/74oBX4KXSBuonmvh8).
Comments are totally anonymous; only the date and time of the submission is
recorded in addition to your feedback.

I will take all comments seriously, and try to do the best that I can to make
sure that you are heard through my actions.
