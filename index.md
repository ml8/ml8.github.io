## Fall'21 -- Spring'22

On leave as Visiting Research Scientist at Google.

## Research

The broad area of my research is distributed data processing
systems--specifically streaming data processing systems.

I am currently interested in how modern, high-performance networks challenge
architectural assumptions in streaming data processing systems.

### Work with Students

I am actively looking for students interested in my work. I have a weekly
research group meeting where we discuss current work, plan future work, and read
and discuss papers. [Contact me](mailto:langm@rhodes.edu) in order to be added
to our Slack channel and be invited to future meetings.

## Teaching

I love teaching computer science because I love sharing my passion for the
discipline with others, especially those who have had no or little prior
experience with it. CS is an especially exciting field of study because it
enables creativityâ€”with a foundational background in Computer Science, people
can build amazing and world-changing things.

My teaching style is informed by my belief that students learn best when they
want to learn. I see my job, then, as to not just to expose students to new
ideas, but to show them why these ideas are exciting and interesting and to
serve as guide in their discovery of knowledge.

## Ethical and Just Computer Science

Here's a [list](justcs.md) of resources/articles related to justice, diversity,
and inclusion in CS that I plan on maintaining.

## Outside the Classroom

I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio, and received my Ph.D. from The Ohio State
University. After my Ph.D. work, I was faculty at Moravian College in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, where I taught a variety of computer science courses. I left
Moravian to work for Google, where I built streaming data analytics platforms
for both internal and Cloud customers. Though it was exciting to work on
Google-scale distributed systems, I missed the fulfillment that teaching
undergraduates provides me, and joined Rhodes in 2019.

I live in Downtown Memphis and outside of the classroom I enjoy food and
cooking, ice hockey, running, and photography, among other hobbies.

### Education
