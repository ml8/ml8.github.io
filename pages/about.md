Hi! I'm Marion Lang. I'm currently a software engineer at
[GitHub](https://github.com). In past lives, I've also been a computer science
professor, most recently at [Rhodes College](https://cs.rhodes.edu). As a
professor, I was passionate about teaching novices, and loved teaching in [small
liberal arts
college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_college#Distinguishing_characteristics)
environments.

As an engineer I'm a generalist, but I have a specific interest in distributed
systems and associated problems of scale. 

My academic background is in specification/verification of distributed
algorithms with a particular interest in properties other than correctness.
