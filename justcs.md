# Just CS

This is a collection of resources, organizations, and articles with a variety of
foci, but all related to _responsible_ and _just_ CS, including increasing and
supporting reprentation in the discipline. This is a list of things that
__I've__ read/collected, so it is by no means exhaustive or complete. I am also
not an expert on these topics, so this is likely to be a shallow/incomplete
view.

Included in this list are organizations related to activism as well as resources
for building a more diverse and inclusive community of computer scientists.

Many resources are intersectional, so the category labels might not be the most
apt. 

This collection will grow over time. __Right now (11-25-20), this is just an
initial dump of some things I've been looking at recently__.

__Please feel free to
[add/edit](https://github.com/ml8/ml8.github.io/edit/main/justcs.md)
this list.__ Pull requests are welcome.
